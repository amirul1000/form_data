 ==========================================================================================================================================


The FormData object lets you compile a set of key/value pairs to send using XMLHttpRequest. It is primarily intended for use in sending form data, but can be used independently from forms in order to transmit keyed data. The transmitted data is in the same format that the form's submit() method would use to send the data if the form's encoding type were set to multipart/form-data.

Using a formdata event
A more recent addition to the platform than the FormData object is the formdata event â€” this is fired on an HTMLFormElement object after the entry list representing the form's data is constructed. This happens when the form is submitted, but can also be triggered by the invocation of a FormData() constructor.

This allows a FormData object to be quickly obtained in response to a formdata event firing, rather than needing to put it together yourself.
